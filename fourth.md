# Linux File Commands: `rm`, `cp`, `touch`, `mv`

## 1. `rm` ‚Äì Remove Files or Directories

### Syntax:
```bash
rm [options] file_name
````

### Common Options:

* `-f` : Force deletion (ignore nonexistent files, never prompt).
* `-r` or `-R` : Recursively delete directories and their contents.
* `-rf` : Combine both to force delete directories and their contents.

### Example:

```bash
rm myfile.txt           # Delete a file
rm -rf myfolder/        # Forcefully delete a folder and everything inside
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: `rm -rf` is a powerful and potentially destructive command. Be cautious using it, especially as root.

## 2. `cp` ‚Äì Copy Files and Directories

### Syntax:

```bash
cp [options] source destination
```

### Common Options:

* `-r` : Copy directories recursively.
* `-v` : Verbose output, shows files as they are copied.

### Example:

```bash
cp file1.txt backup.txt             # Copy a file
cp -rv myfolder/ backup_folder/    # Copy a folder recursively and verbosely
```
